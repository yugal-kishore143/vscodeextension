## 🔊 Platform Support

| OS      | Audio Method                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | PowerShell `System.Media.SoundPlayer`(built-in) |
| macOS   | `afplay`(built-in)                              |
| Linux   | Auto-detects best available player (see below)    |

### 🐧 Linux Audio — Auto Fallback

The extension automatically tries these players in order — no setup needed if any one is installed:

| Priority | Player     | Install command                       |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st      | `paplay` | `sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils` |
| 2nd      | `aplay`  | `sudo apt install alsa-utils`       |
| 3rd      | `ffplay` | `sudo apt install ffmpeg`           |
| 4th      | `mpg123` | `sudo apt install mpg123`           |
| 5th      | `cvlc`   | `sudo apt install vlc`              |

> Most Linux systems already have `aplay` (ALSA) built in — so it should just work out of the box.

## 📂 Sound Files

The extension uses the following sound files located in the `sounds/` directory:

* `fahhh.wav` — Failure sound
* `jaihoo.wav` — Success sound

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The extension listens for task completions in VS Code. Depending on the task's exit code, it plays the appropriate sound:

* **Success (exit code 0):** Plays `jaihoo.wav`
* **Failure (non-zero exit code):** Plays `fahhh.wav`
